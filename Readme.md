This project contains some machine learning subjects for classification such as Multi-Layer perceptron(MLP), Bayesian, K-nearest neighbor(KNN), and Support vector machine(SVM) that are used on the Diabetes dataset which is the dataset from Kaggle.

All models and functions from one library are scikit-learn
